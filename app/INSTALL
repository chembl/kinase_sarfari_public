1. Pre Install Requirements
---------------------------

Make sure you have imported the kinase sarfari Oracle database. Follow the
instructions provided in database/INSTALL-DATABASE


2. Install Perl (Optional)
--------------------------

Required Perl Version: >= 5.8.x (If you decide to use Perl version 5.10.0 
please see note at end of file)

If you do not have an appropriate version of Perl installed or would like 
to install Perl in a new location proceed with the following steps, 
otherwise move on to stage 3.

$> wget http://www.cpan.org/src/perl-5.8.9.tar.gz
$> tar -xzf perl-5.8.9.tar.gz 
$> cd perl-5.8.9

If you wish to install Perl in a location other /usr/local include the 
-Dprefix option below. An example replacement for INSTALL_LOCATION would 
be /opt/perl

$> sh Configure -de -Dprefix=INSTALL_LOCATION
$> make
$> make test
$> make install


3. Install Kinase Sarfari Application 
-------------------------------------

Download kinasesarfari.tar.gz

Make sure you replace PATH-TO-PERL in the commands below with the 
appropriate value. If you are using the system Perl it will probably be
/usr/bin/perl (root required). If you have installed a new version of Perl
in /opt/perl it will be /opt/perl/bin/perl.

$> tar -zxf kinasesarfari.tar.gz
$> cd kinasesarfari/
$> PATH-TO-PERL Makefile.PL
$> make installdeps

If you encounter any problems when installing modules installing you may 
need to open the CPAN shell to investigate further. To restart install run
the following:

$> make realclean
$> PATH-TO-PERL Makefile.PL
$> make installdeps

DBD::Oracle may require a CPAN force install depending on the privileges 
set up on the Oracle database being used. Before doing so ensure you can 
independently connect to the database (e.g. using sqlplus)


4. Setup Database Connection
----------------------------
   
Add database connection parameters to configuration file. You need to 
change the following lines in sarfari.yml file:
   
   database:
       driver: Oracle
       name: DATABASE_NAME
       username: USERNAME
       password: PASSWORD
   
You need to update DATABASE_NAME, USERNAME and PASSWORD with local 
settings. 


5. Setup BLAST EXE Location
---------------------------
   
Depending on the platform the application is being installed on you 
will need to set the BLAST path executable. Test to see if you already
have an appropriate executable on your system by running the following 
command:

$> blastall -

You should be presented with the blastall options. If the command is not
found please see note at end of file, which tells you how to obtain the 
BLAST executable. 

Edit the blastall location in the app/sarfari.yml file. 

CHANGE

	blast:
    	exe: /nfs/panda/chembl/blastall

TO

	blast:
    	exe: <YOUR-LOCATION>/blastall


6. Test Application Works
-------------------------

Test application works by using the built-in Catalyst test server:

   >PATH-TO-PERL script/sarfari_server.pl -k -f

If no errors have occurred point browser at URL output by sarfari_server.pl

Follow steps in docs/kinasesarfari_testing.doc (or .pdf) to test 
applications basic functionality 


* Note on Perl 5.10.0
---------------------

You can use Perl version 5.10.0, however after downloading and extracting
the source code the following patch needs to be applied to toke.c line 
692 (diff format):

 #else
     parser->nexttoke = 0;
 #endif
+    parser->error_count = oparser ? oparser->error_count : 0;
     parser->copline = NOLINE;
     parser->lex_state = LEX_NORMAL;
     parser->expect = XSTATE;

For more details on this issue refer to:

* Note on Obtaining BLAST Executable
------------------------------------

All files are available to download from the ncbi website: 

ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/executables/LATEST/

In the following commands RELEASE and PLATFORM need to replaced with 
the correct values. Refer to link above to determine what these are 
for your system.

Download:

$> wget ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/executables/LATEST/blast-RELEASE-PLATFORM.tar.gz

Extract: 

$> tar -zxf blast-RELEASE-PLATFORM.tar.gz

Test:

$> blast-RELEASE/bin/blastall -
